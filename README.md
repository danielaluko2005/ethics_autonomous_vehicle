The Ethical Engine is a python programming project that is designed to engage introductory CS students with ethical design. The scaffolding and rationale behind this project will [can be read at this Medium post](https://medium.com/@evanmpeck/the-ethical-engine-integrating-ethical-design-into-intro-to-computer-science-4f9874e756af).

1. **Building the Ethical Engine:** Modeled off of [MIT's Moral Machine](http://moralmachine.mit.edu/), students are presented with [randomly-generated scenarios](student_code/scenario.py) in which an autonomous car must decide between saving the passengers in the car OR the pedestrians in the crosswalk. They must write a program that decides who the car should save. There are a number of factors that students must take into account, including demographics (age, gender, etc.), profession (doctor, homeless, criminal, etc.), body type, whether pedestrians were crossing the street legally, and whether the car must swerve to save the pedestrians.

2. After writing the program students submit the program and a short two page reflection piece where they reflect on what they have learned.
